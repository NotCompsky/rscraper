# NAME

rscraper-hub - Manage *rscraper(1)* tags.

# SYNOPSIS
rscraper-hub

# POSSIBLE ISSUES

If you add too many tags to a category, the window height will become too large for the screen. This shouldn't be a problem - you can scale/drag/etc the window nicely in KDE, and in Gnome you can hold the `Super` key to click and drag the window.

It's annoying though, and will be mitigated soon, probably by putting individual categories into scrollable areas.

# SEE ALSO
