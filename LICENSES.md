## libb64

libb64's author is Chris Venter, the source code as libb64.sourceforge.net, and it is released into the public domain. However, I use a version modified by github.com/cburstedde, and besides live in a jurisdiction where IIRC works cannot be declared to be in the public domain.

According to http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LGPLStaticVsDynamic:

This repository provides the application in source format and therefore complies.
